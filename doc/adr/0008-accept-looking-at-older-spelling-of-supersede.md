# 8. Accept looking at older spelling of supersede

Date: 2022-05-01

## Status

Accepted

Supercedes [7. This one will be superseded old style](0007-this-one-will-be-superseded-old-style.md)

## Context

The original scripts version still uses the alternate spelling supercede and not the correct spelline supersede. This spelling was fixed for this viewer but doesn't match docs already created with the older version.

## Decision

Accept the older spelling along with the correct spelling for parsing the config options.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
