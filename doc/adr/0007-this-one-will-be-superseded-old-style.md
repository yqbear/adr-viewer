# 7. This one will be superseded old style

Date: 2022-05-01

## Status

Superceded by [8. Accept looking at older spelling of supersede](0008-accept-looking-at-older-spelling-of-supersede.md)

## Context

The original scripts version still uses the alternate spelling supercede and
not the correct spelline supersede. This spelling was fixed for this viewer
but doesn't match docs already created with the older version.

## Decision

Don't worry about it. Just change to the new spelling even if the orignal
tool isn't changed yet.

## Consequences

This will leave old spelled ADR's with a question mark in the html instead
of as superseded.
